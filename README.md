## Hello Smart Fellas (or maybe your a fart smella) ##

i made a repo

because 

if you aren't familiar with repo you are about to be. 

### 2 options ###
copy the code manually like a fart smella
or clone the repo like a smart fella

you might need to install git if you havent

In your command prompt (in the directory/folder where you want to save this)
>```sh
> git clone https://github.com/astrauc/enee245.git
> ```

And then if you want to put your changes in the repo:
>```sh
> git add . 
> git commit -m "Howdy. Put whatever message you want here"
> git push
>```

> [!NOTE]
> the "." in the add command means everything in the current directory. feel free to only say specific files

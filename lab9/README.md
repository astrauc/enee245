## Lab 9: Finite State Machines ##

**Lowkey am super busy Tuesday so I started this up**

So I followed the instructions on the prelab and also looked some stuff up because there is a bunch of FSM implementations out there so I just took **heavy** inspiration from others.

>[!NOTE]
>I have no idea how correct my implementations are .
> I did not feel like testing it all today, so lets do that tomorrow (Tuesday)
